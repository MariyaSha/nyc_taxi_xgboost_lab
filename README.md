## Overview 📚

Ever wondered what makes people tip more in taxis? 💵  
In this hands-on machine learning project, we’ll build a complete workflow on **real NYC Yellow Taxi data** — cleaned, engineered, and trained entirely on **GPU using XGBoost CUDA and cuDF Pandas**. 🐼

You’ll see how professionals approach problems, handle massive data, and fix memory errors — designing real data-science pipelines step-by-step.

## Environment Setup 🚀 

You can run this project in two ways:

### 1️⃣ Google Colab  
- Change runtime to **T4 GPU**  
- Use the smaller version of the dataset (≈ 5 million rows)  
- Download from repo and store in your Google Drive `Distilled_2023_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data.csv`
- Use the following code snippet to mount your goodle drive:
```
# mount your google drive - connect it to your notebook
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```
- Use the following code snippet to load your dataset:
```
%load_ext cudf.pandas
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/path_to_your_dataset/Distilled_2023_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data.csv")
data.tail()
```

### 2️⃣ Local Setup  
- Requires a **CUDA-compatible GPU**  
- Recommended: **WSL + Miniforge/Conda** (other setups may fail)  
- Install RAPIDS following the [official installation guide](https://docs.rapids.ai/install/)  
- Use the full **NYC Taxi Dataset (≈ 38 million rows)**
